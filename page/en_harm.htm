							<h3><span>Plastic waste to the world's annual emissions of 8 million tons of marine suffocation</span></h3>

							<p >　Foreign media said that the earth's oceans are being blocked by the plastic garbage, but every year how much plastic waste discharged into the ocean? Equivalent to the global each coastal state and region of the coastal line every 30 cm stacked 5 shopping bags full of plastic waste.</br>

　　According to Reuters reported in February 12th, this is the latest research results released by scientists 12. They estimate according to the data in 2010, the annual average of about 8 million tons of plastic waste from the world's 192 coastal countries and regions into the ocean.</br>
In view of the increasing number of plastic waste, they expect that in 2015 there will be more than 9 million tons of plastic waste discharged into the ocean.</br>
Annual emissions of marine plastic garbage most of China, it has been estimated that 2.4 million tons, accounting for about 30% of the global total, followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Egypt, Malaysia, Nigeria and Bangladesh.</br>
The United States is the only developed country to enter the top 20, ranking twentieth.

Plastic rubbish floating on the ocean</p><p>
Plastic garbage, including any conceivable plastic products, such as plastic bags, plastic bottles, toys, food packaging materials, fishing gear, sunglasses, buckets, toilet seat ring.
</br>

The data used in this study include the World Bank released the coastal state of the production of waste per capita, the coastal population density, the total amount of plastic waste in various countries and the quality of waste treatment and so on.
</br>
Researchers estimate that in 2010, 192 coastal countries and regions produced 2.75 tons of plastic waste, of which about 8 million tons into the ocean, at least there may be 4 million 800 thousand tons, up to 12 million 700 thousand tons.
</br>
The study was published in the journal Science in the United States.
</br>
According to Spain, "world news" website reported in February 13th, from the beginning of last century, 70s, the pollution of the ocean is to make scientists worried about the problem. But over the past 40 years, there is still no exact statistics on the amount of plastic products that are discharged into the sea each year. An American research group released its first report on the world's 192 coastal countries and regions that have been released into the ocean for improper management.
</br>
The detailed research report reflects the seriousness of the ocean pollution. The scientists analyzed the production, population density, and economic data of each country's solid waste. And this data is placed in the specific context of the measure, compared with the world's plastic production, to determine whether the data is high.
</br>
Led the study at the University of Georgia, a professor of environmental engineering Jenna Jambek in 12 press conference said: "we haven't specified which countries, but developing countries do not set up proper waste disposal system.
</br>
Participated in the study of the American Association of marine education experts Carla Lavender pointed out that in order to recognize the plastic pollution in the oceans threat to us, it is necessary to know how much of the rubbish, where and how to harm marine species. University of California Santa Barbara campus Roland Gaye said: "the data is worrying, but not beyond all expectations.

							<p >　Scientists estimate that the world's floating plastic garbage on the ocean more than 5 trillion, with a total weight of 269 thousand tons.
</br>
　International Online Zhuangao: according to the British "Daily Mail" December 10, reports, recently, a team composed of scientists from a number of countries claim. According to the 2007 to 2013 the Marine Expeditionary 24 times to collect data, plastic garbage floating on the ocean of global estimates more than 5 trillion block, with a total weight of about 26.9 million tons, compared with 2 large cruise ship.
</br>
Scientists use traction network from the great ocean currents, Australia coast, bay of Bengal and the Mediterranean Sea 5 mate tropical "vortexing" dredge plastic garbage, through the summary of the data and the computer simulation, they estimated global marine plastic litter at least 5.25 trillion, the total weight of 268940 tons.
</br>
These plastic garbage, small particles of less than 1 mm, large up to 20 cm. The smallest plastic particles even reach the world's most remote regions, including the sub arctic.

</br>
Research scientist Marcus Erickson said: "our findings show that 5 mate tropical vortex is not global ocean floating plastic final resting place. The plastic particles show that the global marine ecosystem is interacting with each other."

</br>
Scientists also found that large chunks of plastic often appear near the coast. And the number of plastic particles on the surface of the ocean is not as much as people think, which means that many of the plastic particles are being removed. The elimination methods include the decomposition of sunlight, biodegradation, buried in the rubble and beaches, fish and other organic biological digestion and absorption, etc..
</br>
Scientists say this is the first time in the world to make a comparative study of various specifications of plastic floating on the ocean. Plastic on marine organisms has been a threat. For example: in the remote Pacific Islands albatross because of eating too much plastic die; sea turtles and mistakenly plastic bags as jellyfish eat, leading to blockage of the digestive tract, eventually starve to death. It is estimated that 90% of the sea birds died on the beach because of swallowing plastic.
