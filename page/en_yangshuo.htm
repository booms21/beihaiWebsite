It's mountain, it's water, especially the essence of the Lijiang River is also from the middle through. The aura of the Lijiang River is Guilin, Yangshuo's treasure. Of course, it is also a treasure of the Pearl River system. So yesterday, when Foshan Media Group & ldquo; to drink with the Pearl River & rdquo; a series of activities came to the Millennium ancient town, we naturally attention to the Lijiang River, and for the protection of this baby and make contribution to the life in the Lijiang River on the edge of.         <br> - signature

Lijiang Yangshuo Shuifu <br>
In the morning 8 when from Wuzhou of go six hours of the winding road, although the road is bumpy, but the beauty of the mountain is timely to reduce the fatigue. 12 noon to Yangshuo boundary, the beauty of the landscape of Guilin began to gradually appear, the karst formation of a series of mountain, far looked, each one like an object, some looks like a girl. Some also like the old woman. In this magical mountain, in the strange imagination, the team came to the Yangshuo county is located in the town of Lijiang river. A section of the most beautiful Lijiang and would travel to Foshan visitors close at hand. <br>
Standing on the edge of the river, the river is clear. Who lives in Foshan, 26 years later came to the river again in the event of a member of Huang lamented: great change, many people, and lively, but the river clear water or not change. <br>
The river on both sides of the mountain left in the reflection of the Lijiang river. “ this reflection is the most beautiful scenery of the Lijiang river. &rdquo said the owner of the boat; Huang sister dedicated to introduce. In her inspiration, beauty mirror, carp mountain, snail hill is no longer a seat of bland hill, still covered with a layer of mystery. In the accompanying interview Foshan radio reporter Ying Ying Xie although it is for the first time, but saw the mountain this water, straight, and imagination in exactly the same. <br>
About the Lijiang River, yellow sister hide words closely reasoned and well argued, the feelings of the Lijiang river. The 39 year old she worked for 10 years of fishing life, 1996 for a ship (boat market than small, can be used to carry). The middle reaches of Lijiang Xingping section is mainly to do business travel on both sides of the farmers. Later, Yangshuo tourism development, Huang sister concentrate on the start of the tourist business, the current economic situation in her home in Xingping belongs to high income families. “ with the development of tourism, our life has been significantly improved. & rdquo; Huang sister said, originally only by Xu boat trip on both sides of the villagers but also because of the development of tourism economy and in the mountain roads. <br>
Yellow sister home change is a microcosm of Yangshuo tourism, and Yangshuo Tourism Bureau deputy director of the Ge Qingliang remarks perhaps more can macroscopically generalize Yangshuo tourism development situation. Yangshuo tourism real development is from the beginning of 2000, just 6 years, the tourism industry as the leading third industry accounted for 51% of Yangshuo's GDP last year, the financial contribution reached 44%. Last year alone, 3 million 500 thousand people went to Yangshuo tourism. <br>
Tourism unprecedented development, the original quiet landscape can withstand the noise it? <br>
According to Huang sister's observation, in fact, a few years, the Lijiang River water change is not big, or as clear, they still drink the water inside. “ Li River water so that we are rich, how can we pollute it? ” yellow sister said. <br>
Everywhere visible environmental protection guards <br>

The use of biogas has changed the flue gas pollution caused by burning firewood in the past. </p><p>
As Huang sister said, life in the Lijiang River on the edge of of the Lijiang River have a deep feeling, they put it as ancestors left the baby as cherished. Xingping, a retired teacher for decades as one day in the Lijiang River edge pick up tourists discards the garbage bag, but is this went to interview, arbor has died, the reporter could not see the Lijiang River environmental stewardship. However, just a few meters away on the edge of the river a few meters away from the fishing village of 400 years is also a good example. The village in 1982 began to use biogas, the villagers generally believe that the use of biogas has changed in the past to burn firewood to bring the flue gas, so that the home has become clean, also played a protective role on the Lijiang river. At present the village has been named “ renewable energy demonstration village ”. Former U.S. President Clinton also visited the village, the rural areas such clean energy. <br>
The government has begun to act. A few years ago, the Guilin government decided to move away from the sewage plant, and last year, Yangshuo also built Guangxi's first county sewage treatment plant, is responsible for the Yangshuo Metro sewage treatment, and then discharged to the river. “ at present, the world tourism organization is also building an observation point in Yangshuo, one of its goals is the environmental protection level. ” Ge Qingliang said. <br>
Everyone has an obligation to protect the Lijiang River <br>
Hundreds of millions of years, the Lijiang River water has always been here flows, many scholars to compose, only Yangshuo Lijiang River have hundreds of Chinese and foreign celebrities visit. Xu Xiake specifically here tour, Sun Yat sen in 1921 have been to Yangshuo, and to above the village. Up to now, the village is still the village made a & ldquo; Dr. Sun Yat Sen boat at the Department & rdquo; of the stone. <br>
Today, it is still a tourist's need to go to the land. According to the Yangshuo Tourism Department statistics, the tourists have 45% guangdong. “ I'm here a few times a year. ” from Guangzhou yuan this year is the second time to come to the river, for him, the river is a place every year to a place. “ you look at this mountain, this water, where to find our city? ” Mr. Yuan think, to see such a view, everyone has an obligation to protect the Pearl River pearl. </p>

<p>
<br>
   Yangshuo County Yulong River known as "little Lijiang", Chinese and foreign tourists come in a throng already well-known, far and near. Local villagers use unique tourism environment, in the Yulong River opened many Farmhouse Hotel, also attracted some foreigners to seize the investment opportunities opened Farmhouse Hotel, from the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands Roland is the one. <br>
29 year old Roland to Yangshuo for 6 years, has now settled in Yangshuo to buy a house. He especially loves the Chinese history and culture, and strive to guard, and to show visitors. At the same time, the hotel opened farmhouse in the village, but also personally protect the environment health, by the local people praise. Therefore, the locals like to call the Roland as foreign guards". <br>
Love Yangshuo <br>
In April 2005, Roland university has not yet graduated to travel in China, from Beijing and Xi'an has come to Yangshuo, was immediately attracted to the beautiful natural landscape of Yangshuo, completely intoxicated, he produced a thought: go back and finish college, come back Yangshuo tourism. <br>
In June 2006, at the age of 23, after graduating from the Lorand Eotvos University, is nonstop to Yangshuo. "After a period of time, I found that the people of Yangshuo are very tolerant, warm and hospitable, and they are completely in love with Yangshuo." Roland is now able to speak fluent Mandarin. So, in that year, Roland in Yangshuo to find a job as a foreign language teacher. Roland won the students love, this year, he gained love, and a girl to learn English in Liaoning, Yangshuo fall in love. They got married in Yangshuo in 2007. <br>
<br> when foreign teachers less than 1 years time, Roland will resign, opened a cafe in West Street, when a small boss. Once, a Dutch came to the coffee shop pastime, and Roland talked very speculative, Dutch friend hope Roland joined a Dutch company, specialising in China is responsible for the reception of the Dutch team, Roland readily agreed. Coffee shop after 2 years of operation, Roland will be transferred out, to concentrate on the work of the tour guide. <br>
"I work as a tour guide for 2 years, traveled almost every corner of Yangshuo." Roland said with emotion, Yangshuo is really beautiful, I do not want to leave. In 2008, Roland's parents came to Yangshuo and visit him, were also attracted to the unique scenery of Yangshuo, want to retire, but also to Yangshuo stay. <br>
Culture "guard" <br>
In April 2011, Roland rented a house in the village with a Chinese friend who was in the case of the dragon, and planned to open a farmhouse hotel. Can be on the decoration, Roland with friends there are differences, friends think decoration should be trendy, have style. Roland is that hotel opened in the country, to decorate confers certain rural culture in China, but also to let foreign visitors to understand China's countryside is how. <br>
It turned out that Roland in the university study history of professional, but also a special study of German history. "The history of Germany has two parts, one is about the history of the west, and the other is about the history of the East." Roland, at that time, he had a strong interest in Chinese history and culture, often access to Chinese historical information on the internet. <br>
Later, a friend can not convince Roland, the hotel renovation program will be decided by Roland alone. Roland came to hotel, immediately in front of a large circular stone mill, with the support of 2 stout timbers. "This is Chinese rural before the stone mill, mainly used for grinding grain." Roland, introduced a, he in a nearby village see the abandoned stone mill, the in the mind is very like, spent the 2000 yuan of money mailai, placed in the courtyard of the hotel, adding to the many rural atmosphere. <br>
Into the hotel, saw the corridor and rest rooms and dining room walls hung many posters, with elegant frame mounting, about 40 pieces, the content of both the sixties and seventies labors of our country farmer scene written on it "wholeheartedly to serve the people" "labor is glorious" "grasp revolution and promote production" the red words, highly infectious. These posters are very rare in the local area, Roland said, a small part of the local acquisition, most of the online view of online shopping back. "This is socialist culture, and Europe is not. I want visitors to understand the history and culture of China's rural areas, to know that Chinese culture is the world's culture, it is worth guarding, worthy of collection." Here the Rowland excitement shows between the lines. <br>
Roland has added to these posters of love, every day with a towel to wipe the picture again, don't let other people to intervene. Roland operates a total of 12 hotel rooms, mostly foreign tourists come to stay. Interview, I just met from American tourists Mike. He is with relish to enjoying the wall posters, the mouth not to stop to say: "good! GOOD!" Mike is also excited to say that I understand the first time before the Chinese farmers how to work, I like this kind of rural culture. <br>
Local village branch secretary Tao Guoli sigh said countryside, we now barely hanging this during the Cultural Revolution propaganda painted, everyone forget, Roland was so fond of collecting, called "culture" guardian and admirable.
<br> environmental protection "guard" <br>
Hotel renovation, Roland saw the river and the road a lot of garbage piled up, so he hired a car all the rubbish clean, environmental health. "The landscape around it is so charming, and it should be well protected." Roland said.
